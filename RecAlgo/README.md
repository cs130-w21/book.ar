# Book Recommendation


Train and save the model using the following commend. 



Before training, make sure you download the dataset from http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/ and put it under `./dataset/`


```
python train_and_save_model.py
```


Trained models are saved in `./saved_models/`. 

In `test.ipynb` we provide a simple example of how to load a trained model and use it for book recommendation.
